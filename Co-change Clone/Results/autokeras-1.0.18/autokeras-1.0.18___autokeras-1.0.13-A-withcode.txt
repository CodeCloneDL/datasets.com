        It will search for the best model based on the performances on
        validation data.

        # Arguments
            x: numpy.ndarray or tensorflow.Dataset. Training data x. The input data
                should be numpy.ndarray or tf.data.Dataset. The data should be one
                dimensional. Each element in the data should be a string which is a
                full sentence.
            y: numpy.ndarray or tensorflow.Dataset. Training data y. The targets
                passing to the head would have to be tf.data.Dataset, np.ndarray,
                pd.DataFrame or pd.Series. It can be single-column or multi-column.
                The values should all be numerical.
            epochs: Int. The number of epochs to train each model during the search.
                If unspecified, by default we train for a maximum of 1000 epochs,
                but we stop training if the validation loss stops improving for 10
                epochs (unless you specified an EarlyStopping callback as part of
                the callbacks argument, in which case the EarlyStopping callback you
                specified will determine early stopping).
            callbacks: List of Keras callbacks to apply during training and
                validation.
            validation_split: Float between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.2.
                Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
                The model will set apart this fraction of the training data,
                will not train on it, and will evaluate
                the loss and any model metrics
                on this data at the end of each epoch.
                The validation data is selected from the last samples
                in the `x` and `y` data provided, before shuffling. This argument is
                not supported when `x` is a dataset.
                The best model found would be fit on the entire dataset including the
                validation data.
            validation_data: Data on which to evaluate the loss and any model metrics
                at the end of each epoch. The model will not be trained on this data.
                `validation_data` will override `validation_split`. The type of the
                validation data should be the same as the training data.
                The best model found would be fit on the training dataset without the
                validation data.
            **kwargs: Any arguments supported by
                [keras.Model.fit](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model#fit).
        # Returns
            history: A Keras History object corresponding to the best model.
                Its History.history attribute is a record of training
                loss values and metrics values at successive epochs, as well as
                validation loss values and validation metrics values (if applicable).
